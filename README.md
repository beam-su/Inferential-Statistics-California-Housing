# Inferential-Statistics-California-Housing
Final coursework submission for DESE71017 - Inferential Statistics and Causal Reasoning 2024-2025

## Abstract
This project applies inferential statistics techniques to analyse the California Housing dataset. The objective is to explore relationships between housing prices and various demographic and geographic factors, utilising hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

## Methodology
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics, distribution analysis.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: T-tests, chi-square tests.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Estimation of population parameters.
- **Linear Regression Analysis**: Relationship modeling between features.

## Results
- Higher median incomes correlate with higher house values.
- House age does not significantly impact prices.
- Population density has a weak negative correlation with median house value.
